## Spark Notes
- **Stack** Every build is powered by `HTML`, `CSS`, and vanilla `JavaScript` â€” no frameworks allowed in this playground.
- **Vibes** Short, sweet experiments designed to teach, delight, and inspire curiosity.
- **Mission** Ship mini projects fast, learn something new every time, and keep things fun.

## Projects on Stage
| Project | What You'll See | Tech | Peek |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`Project-1-Portfolio-Website/`](Project-1-Portfolio-Website/) | A vibrant personal portfolio with animated hero fonts, Vanta.js waves, and a friendly contact form. | HTML Â· CSS Â· JavaScript | ![Portfolio preview](https://media.giphy.com/media/11sBLVxNs7v6WA/giphy.gif) |
| *(up next: To-Do List App)* | Add, edit, and delete tasks right in the browser with localStorage to keep them around forever. | HTML Â· CSS Â· JavaScript | ![To-do preview](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExcHczaDMzbDJuemsxNzg3MTFrNHRmb2RkdDVicjI4MzA2Zmx6bHYzNSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/h3VvCtvoLRC2TmjfSO/giphy.gif) |

## Quickstart
```bash
# clone the playground
 git clone https://github.com/bhushcodes/portfolio-mini-project.git
 cd portfolio-mini-project

# explore a project
 cd Project-1-Portfolio-Website
 open index.html
```
- **Serve locally** Use your favorite static server (`python -m http.server`, `npx serve`, or VS Code Live Server) to enjoy smooth routing and asset loading.
- **Mobile check** Open DevTools and toggle device mode to see responsive tricks in action.

## Roll Your Own Mini
- **Duplicate** Copy the template from an existing project folder and rename it `Project-X-Your-Title/`.
- **Build** Keep it `HTML + CSS + JS` only â€” bonus points for clever DOM sorcery.
- **Showcase** Add a row to the Projects table with a catchy description, tech tags, and a GIF or screenshot.
- **Commit** Use energetic commit messages and share what you learned in the description.

## Roadmap
- **Now Cooking** To-Do List app blueprint â€” add/edit/delete tasks, localStorage persistence, and playful micro-animations.
- **Idea Vault** Waiting for the next spark. Casting a wide net for future minis (games? widgets? surprise tools?). Suggestions welcome!
- **Docs** Add contribution guide and mini project template checklist.

## Behind the Scenes
- **Design** Crafted with playful typography, bold gradients, and motion that respects reduced-motion settings.
- **Accessibility** Keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, and plenty of contrast are always on the checklist.
- **Performance** Light on dependencies, heavy on creativity. Everything loads fast and works offline once cached.
